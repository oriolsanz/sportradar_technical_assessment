Technical Assessment for iOS Software Engineers in SportRadar

Architecture: 
I even used an architecture because the project it's too small for it. In an ipothetical case I would use MVVM and would create a ViewModel for all the interaction in the View (ViewController class)

Key classes: 
The VolumeControlView is a reusable custom view component that provides a visual representation of volume levels. It can be easily customized to fit different design requirements by adjusting the number of bars, color, and spacing.

Tests: I did a basic testing with unitTests. It could be improved and testing more deeply but I think is not that necessary in this kind of test projects. If the component should be implemented in more classes and was a real project it should be tested so much hard.

Additional Notes:
I tested basic things with iPad and iPhone running the app. I forced it to be portrait.

Given my experience with UIKit, I believe I've delivered a well-structured and functional solution.
